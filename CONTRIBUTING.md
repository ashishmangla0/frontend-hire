## Content Contribution Guide

We're always looking for high-quality content to help frontend developers learn and grow. Here's how you can contribute content:

1. **Create or choose a content issue**: 
   - Check existing [content request issues](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/frontend-hire/issues) to see if there's something you'd like to work on.
   - If you have a new content idea, create a new issue using the content request template.

2. **Create your author profile**:
   - Add your profile to the `src/content/authors` folder.
   - Use existing profiles as a reference for the required information.

3. **Create the content**:
   - Follow the structure of existing content as a guide.
   - Ensure your content is clear, concise, and valuable to the community.

4. **For coding questions**:
   - Include an embed URL from platforms like Stackblitz, CodeSandbox, or similar IDEs.
   - This allows readers to interact with the code directly.

5. **Video content**:
   - While we appreciate video content, ensure it's specific to the topic.
   - We encourage you to create your own videos rather than using third-party content.

6. **Submit your contribution**:
   - Create a pull request with your new content.
   - Link the related content request issue in your pull request description.

   - Look through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/frontend-hire/issues) for features or bugs you'd like to work on.
   - If you've found a new bug or have a feature idea, create a new issue describing it.

2. **Create your author profile** (if you haven't already):
   - Add your profile to the `src/content/authors` folder.

3. **Work on the issue**:
   - Fork the repository and create a branch for your work.
   - Make your changes, following our coding standards and guidelines.

4. **Submit your contribution**:
   - Create a pull request with your changes.
   - Link the related issue in your pull request description.

## Pull Request Process

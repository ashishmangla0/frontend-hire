# Style Active Route

You have an App with multiple routes but it is difficult to identify which route is currently active. How can you style the active route?

> They kept getting caught in an infinite loop of dynamic routes!

## Objectives

- You have multiple pages in your App.
- There is no visual indication of which page is active unless you check the URL or main body content (this might not be the case all the time).
- Use Regular CSS or Tailwind CSS (already configured for you) to style the active route.

# What are Web Vitals?

> Web Vitals are Google's metrics for measuring user experience on websites, focusing on loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.

## Answer

Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. The subset of Web Vitals that are most important is the Core Web Vitals.

The current Core Web Vitals are:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## Follow Up Questions

### What is the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)?

> "LCP reports the render time of the largest image, text block, or video visible in the viewport, relative to when the user first navigated to the page." - [web.dev definition of LCP.](https://web.dev/articles/lcp#what-is-lcp)

An example would be if you load a marketing website then most probably the hero section would be the LCP.

### What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)?

INP takes into account all the user interactions made and reports the metric as the longest-observed interaction. These interactions are:

- Mouse Click Input
- Touch Input
- Keyboard Input

INP replaces the First Input Delay (FID) for a better responsiveness metric. As the first input might not usually be the main input for a webpage.

### What is Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)?

> CLS is a measure of the largest burst of _layout shift scores_ for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifecycle of a page. - [web.dev definition of CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls#what-is-cls)

This measures visual stability. It helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts.

### How do you measure any of these Core Web Vitals?

Google has a couple of tools to measure these vitals in the lab and field.

Lab Tools (cannot give you INP score as there is no user input):

- Chrome DevTools
- Lighthouse

Field Tools:

- Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)
- PageSpeed Insights
- Search Console
- Can also setup custom data collection with JavaSciprt using web-vitals package

### Is the Lighthouse test in the dev tools a good measure of these vitals?

Since it is a lab test, it can be a good starting point but checking the field data would be a better and more productive metric to consider!

# What is a Domain?

> Be clear, crisp, and concise when answering this question. If you are unsure about something, let the interviewer know. It is completely okay to be unsure.

## Answer

To access any website on the internet you have to know the IP Address of that website (Something like `142.250.71.46`, this is Google's IP Address) these IP Addresses are difficult to remember. So, to make it easier we instead use human-friendly names called domains (like `google.com`).

<Callout>
How to check the IP Address of a website? We can use the `nslookup` command. We use the domain name to get the IP Address in this case.

```bash
nslookup google.com

Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 142.250.71.46
```

## Follow Up Questions

### What is DNS?

Domain Naming System (DNS) is the system that maps those domain names to IP addresses. When we type a domain name in the browser, it is translated to an IP address. We call this process DNS Resolution.

	DNS is a huge topic. We will break down the topic with further standalone
	questions. But as a follow-up question, the above answer is enough.

### How many parts does a domain have?

Every domain has parts to it.

For example, `google.com` has two parts: `google` and `com`. Here, `google` is called the **second-level domain (SLD)** and `com` is called the **top-level domain (TLD)**. In the case, of `google.co.in`, there are three parts: `google`, `co`, and `in`. `google` is called the **third-level domain**. `co` is the **SLD**. `in` is called the **TLD**.

There is virtually no limit to how many lower levels a domain can have. But mostly the levels are around 2-4.

### What is a subdomain?

The subdomain is an independent domain part of a main domain. For example, if we have `company.com` and `store.company.com`, `company.com` is the **main domain** and `blog.company.com` is the **subdomain**.

Subdomains help us to better organize our web entities or projects.

<Callout>
	We call URLs that use directories after the main domain (like
	company.com/blog) **"subdirectories"** while URLs that add a prefix before the
	main domain (like blog.company.com) are called **"subdomains"**.

	If this was asked in an interview, and if you have researched the company and
	its products or services. Try to take direct examples from the company to
	answer this question.

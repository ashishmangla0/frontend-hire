# Solution

We will be following TDD approach to solve this problem. According to which, we will write test cases first and then write code to pass the test cases. Test cases for reversing a linked list are very simple. We will create a linked list and then reverse it. We will then compare the reversed linked list with the expected linked list.

## Test Cases

```js title="index.test.js" showLineNumbers
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';

import { reverseLinkedList } from '.';
import { LinkedList } from './linked-list';

describe('reverse-linked-list', () => {
	test('should reverse a linked list', () => {
		const linkedList = new LinkedList();
		linkedList.insert(1);
		linkedList.insert(2);
		linkedList.insert(3);
		linkedList.insert(4);
		linkedList.insert(5);
		reverseLinkedList(linkedList);
		expect(linkedList.getList()).toEqual([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]);
	});

	test('should reverse a linked list with two elements', () => {
		const linkedList = new LinkedList();
		linkedList.insert(1);
		linkedList.insert(2);
		reverseLinkedList(linkedList);
		expect(linkedList.getList()).toEqual([2, 1]);
	});

	test('should return same list if it is empty', () => {
		const linkedList = new LinkedList();
		reverseLinkedList(linkedList);
		expect(linkedList.getList()).toEqual([]);
	});

	test('should return same list if it has only one element', () => {
		const linkedList = new LinkedList();
		linkedList.insert(1);
		reverseLinkedList(linkedList);
		expect(linkedList.getList()).toEqual([1]);
	});
});
```

After writing the above tests, we can see that the test cases are failing. We will now write the code to actually pass the test cases.

<Callout>
The repo already comes with a linked-list implemented as a helper but in an interview you might be asked to implement one!

Don't know how to create a linked list? Check out [our question](http://localhost:3000/questions/dsa/coding/linked-list-implementation) on implementing one. The helper in this repo comes with another method to get a list which uses an array to represent the linked list.

Let's write the code to reverse a linked list.

Before writing the code, let's think about the approach.

We will be using two pointers to reverse the linked list. We will be iterating through the linked list and reversing the direction of the pointers.

These steps we will be following:

1. Initialize two pointers: `current` and `previous`.
2. Initially `current` will be the head of the linked list and `previous` will be `null`.
3. Iterate through the linked list.
   `loop started`
4. For storing the next node, we will be using a temporary variable.
5. We will assign value of `previous` to `current.next`.
6. After that we will be assigning value of `current` to `previous`. As we already broken the link of `current` node with `next` node, we don't need to worry about loosing the next node.
7. For moving forward, we will be assigning value of `temp` to `current`. As we have stored the next node in `temp`, we can safely move forward.
   `loop ended`
8. After the loop, in `previous` we will have the new head of the linked list. So, we will return the value of `previous`.

Let's write the code for the above approach.

```js title="index.js" showLineNumbers
export function reverseLinkedList(linkedList) {
	let current = linkedList.head;
	let previous = null;

	while (current) {
		const temp = current.next;
		current.next = previous;
		previous = current;
		current = temp;
	}

	linkedList.head = previous;
	return linkedList;
}
```

The tests should pass now.

## Why we started Frontend Hire

Our founder observed huge gaps in the skill set of frontend developers and the expectations of the companies hiring them.

- Sometimes, folks with less experience on paper were better at the job than those with more experience.
- A lot of experienced folks have stagnated in their learning due to their work being repetitive and not challenging.
- Companies, though, always want to hire folks with more experience on paper.

These are problems and we want to solve them.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to help frontend developers grow in their careers and help companies hire good talent. We plan to do this by:

- We provide frontend questions with a coding workspace that helps you prepare for interviews and learn for the real world.
- We provide highly specific courses to help you learn excellent skills in a short period.
- We are already working on hiring tools to help companies employ good talent (some tools should be out by early 2025).

## Why are we open source?

We initially were not open source. Our founder wrote a [more detailed blog post](/blog/going-open-source) about the same.

> TLDR: We thought we could make money. We are not making enough for the effort we put into it. So, rather than abandoning the project entirely, we decided to make it open source, allowing the community to benefit from and potentially build upon our work.

## Our Team

We are a small team, our founder, and a few excellent folks from the community. We are working hard to make this happen. We are always looking for feedback and suggestions. You can reach out to us on [the discord server](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).

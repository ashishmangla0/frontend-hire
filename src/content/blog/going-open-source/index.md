I started this project for fun back in [October 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yarala-hruthik-reddy_webproduct-sandpack-frontend-activity-7119624768462413825-fPjt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

It was free to use back then. I thought I could also make money if I charged for it. Made some. But did not make enough for the effort. So, here I am making it open source and free for everyone.

It has come a full-circle.

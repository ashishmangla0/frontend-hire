# Todo App with React, TypeScript, and TDD

<Callout type='tip'>
	There is also a [Svelte version](/courses/todo-app-svelte/overview) of this
	course for Pro users.
</Callout>

Todo apps are a great way to learn a new language or framework. We teach this course with more than React.

A high-level overview of the things that this course will teach you:

- Good Project Setup for React (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged)
- Component Composition
- Testing with Vitest and React Testing Library

```sh
npm create vite@latest todo-app -- --template react-ts npm create vite@latest todo-app -- --template react-ts
```

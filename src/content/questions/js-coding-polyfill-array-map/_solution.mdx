# Solution

TDD (test-driven development) shines in this type of scenario. We will also use the same approach here.

## Understanding the Array.map() Method

Let us first understand the array map method by trying out a few examples.

<Callout>
	We suggest you also do this in an interview setting. As this helps you form a
	better thought process. This also clears up some of the edge cases. You can
	also pull up the documentation (we encourage doing this) if the interviewer
	has no issue with that.
</Callout>

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

arr.map((number) => number * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

function square(number) {
	return number * number;
}

arr.map(square); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

arr.map((...args) => console.log(args)); // [1, 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]], [2, 1, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]] etc.,
// Basically, the first argument is the item, the second is the index, and the third is the array itself.
```

So, the map method takes a callback function as a parameter and returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the array.

<Callout type='warn'>
	Array.map method also takes another parameter which is `thisArg`. This is a
	little out of the scope of this question. But it is used to specify the value
	of `this` inside the callback function.
</Callout>

## Tests

Let us first write the tests for the following cases:

### Maps values based on the item

```js title="index.test.js"
test('maps values based on the item', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

	expect(arr.myMap((item) => item * 2)).toEqual([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);
});
```

This is the most common use case that we also use with the regular map method.

### Maps values based on the index

```js title="index.test.js"
test('maps values based on the index', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

	expect(arr.myMap((_item, index) => index * 2)).toEqual([0, 2, 4, 6, 8]);
});
```

This time instead of the first argument of the callback function, we use the second argument. We use `_underscore` to indicate that we are not using the first argument.

### Maps values based on the item and the array itself

```js title="index.test.js"
test('maps values based on the item and the array itself', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

	expect(arr.myMap((item, _index, array) => item * array.length)).toEqual([
		5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
	]);
});
```

We now use both the first and the third argument in the callback function. Just using the third argument does not make any sense.

Putting them all together:

```js title="index.test.js" showLineNumbers
import { describe, test, beforeAll, expect } from 'vitest';

import { myMap } from '.';

describe('polyfill-array-map', () => {
	beforeAll(() => {
		Array.prototype.myMap = myMap;
	});

	test('maps values based on the item', () => {
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

		expect(arr.myMap((item) => item * 2)).toEqual([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);
	});

	test('maps values based on the index', () => {
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

		expect(arr.myMap((_item, index) => index * 2)).toEqual([0, 2, 4, 6, 8]);
	});

	test('maps values based on the item and the array itself', () => {
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

		expect(arr.myMap((item, _index, array) => item * array.length)).toEqual([
			5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
		]);
	});
});
```

## The Polyfill

<Callout type='error'>
	The actual implementation would be different from what we implement here. This
	is because for an interview setting this is more than enough. But if you were
	actually implementing a JS polyfill for production (quite rare), you would
	need to check the actual specification and handle more edge cases than what
	you see here.
</Callout>

Now that the basic tests are done, we can start implementing the actual polyfill.

```js title="index.js" ins={2}
export function myMap(cb) {
	const result = [];
}
```

We will use the `result` array to store the mapped values. Remember that we need to return a new array and not modify the original array. Of course, we return a shallow copy of the original array.

```js title="index.js" ins={4-8}
export function myMap(cb) {
	const result = [];

	for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
		result.push(cb(this[i], i, this));
	}

	return result;
}
```

Now for each of the values in the original array, we call the callback function and push the result to the `result` array. As per our understanding of the Array.map method, we have to pass the following arguments to the callback function:

- The item: **this[i]**
- The index: **i**
- The array itself: **this**

We then just return the `result` array. This should pass all the tests.

# Currying - 1

> Use case? Currying is a technique in functional programming that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. A generic curry function allows you to curry any function, increasing flexibility and reusability in your code.

## Objectives

- Implement a generic `curry` function that can curry any function with a fixed number of arguments.
- The curried function should be callable with any number of arguments.
- If all arguments are provided, it should return the result of the original function.
- If fewer arguments are provided, it should return a new function expecting the remaining arguments.

### Sample Input and Expected Output

```js
const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
const curriedSum = curry(sum);

curriedSum(1)(2)(3); // Output: 6
curriedSum(1, 2)(3); // Output: 6
curriedSum(1)(2, 3); // Output: 6
curriedSum(1, 2, 3); // Output: 6
```

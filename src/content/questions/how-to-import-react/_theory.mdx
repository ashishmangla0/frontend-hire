# How to import React?

> The answer isn't as simple as `import React from 'react'`. The way you answer this can tell a lot about your JavaScript knowledge.

The most common way to import React is by the following way:

```jsx {1}
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
	return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default App;
```

But technically, you do not need to import React at all for the above code to work. The below code will work absolutely well in modern React (**Starting with React 17**).

```jsx
const App = () => {
	return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default App;
```

However the above code won't work in older versions of React (**less than 17**) and you would see an error `"React is not defined"`.

## Follow Up Questions

### Why do older versions throw an error?

When you write the following code:

```jsx
const App = () => {
	return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default App;
```

It gets transpiled to the following code:

```jsx {2}
const App = () => {
	return /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, World!');
};
export default App;
```

Now, as you can see, the React import is needed!

### Why is the React import optional now?

The React team found that importing React when it was not being explicitly used was confusing a lot of folks. So, they created a new JSX transformer for Babel and other compilers to automatically import React.

Now the following code:

```jsx
const App = () => {
	return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default App;
```

Will get transpiled to the following code:

```jsx {1,3-5}
import { jsx as _jsx } from 'react/jsx-runtime';
const App = () => {
	return /*#__PURE__*/ _jsx('div', {
		children: 'Hello, World!',
	});
};
export default App;
```

The JSX transformer automatically imports the `jsx` function from the `react/jsx-runtime` package. This is same as React.createElement() with a few more improvements.

	You can use tools like [Babel's Repl](https://babeljs.io/repl) to see the
	above transpilation in action.

### How do you import something from React?

Well we can bring back the old way of importing React and use the global namespace to use something from it.

```jsx {1,4}
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

	return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
};

export default App;
```

Or we can import the needed function directly from React.

```jsx {1,4}
import { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
};

export default App;
```

### Which is better? Importing the whole of React or just the things needed?

Both are the same from a performance perspective. Only the readability is different. The whole of the React library is included in both cases.

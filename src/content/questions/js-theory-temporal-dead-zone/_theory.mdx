# Explain Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

> Understanding Temporal Dead Zone is crucial for mastering variable scoping in JavaScript, especially in modern JavaScript with `let` and `const`.

## Answer

According to the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz), the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** refers to the period between entering a scope (block or function) and the actual declaration of a variable using `let`, `const`, or `class`. During this period, even though the variable is bound in memory, it is not accessible and any attempt to reference it will result in a `ReferenceError`.

The TDZ applies to variables declared with `let` and `const`, and functions defined using `class`. It's important to note that variables declared with `var` do not experience a TDZ and are hoisted differently.

### Example of Temporal Dead Zone

```javascript
{
	console.log(variableOne); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variableOne' before initialization
	let variableOne = 21; // TDZ ends here
}
```

In this case, the variable `variableOne` is declared with `let`, but it cannot be accessed before its declaration. Attempting to do so results in an error.

```javascript
{
	let variableOne; // Declaration happens here, TDZ ends
	console.log(variableOne); // undefined, but no error
	variableOne = 21; // Assignment happens after declaration
	console.log(variableOne); // 21
}
```

Here, `variableOne` is declared with `let`, and even though it is declared but not initialized, the TDZ ends after the declaration, and you can safely access it (even though it's `undefined` until assignment).

	Keep in mind, the **Temporal Dead Zone** only applies to `let`, `const`, and
	`class` declarations, not `var`. This behavior makes `let` and `const` more
	predictable.

### How is TDZ different from hoisting?

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are technically hoisted but remain in the TDZ until the code execution reaches the line where they are declared. This is in contrast to `var` variables, which are hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.

### Why does `var` not have a Temporal Dead Zone?

The `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized to `undefined` immediately, meaning you can access the variable before its declaration (though the value will be `undefined`). With `let` and `const`, no such initialization happens until the variable is declared.

### Why does accessing variables in the TDZ throw a `ReferenceError` instead of returning `undefined`?

This behavior ensures that `let` and `const` are not used before their declaration, enforcing more predictable and error-free code execution. Returning `undefined` would break the principle of the TDZ, which is to prevent access before declaration.

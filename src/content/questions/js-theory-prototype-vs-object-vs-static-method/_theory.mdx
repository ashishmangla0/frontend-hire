# Explain Attaching a Function to Prototype of an Object vs to the Object Itself vs Static Methods

> Understanding the differences between attaching functions to an object's prototype, directly to the object itself, and as static methods is crucial for effective JavaScript programming and proper use of object-oriented patterns.

## Answer

In JavaScript, there are a few ways to attach functions to objects or classes. Some of which are:

1. To the object's prototype
2. Directly to the object itself (instance method)
3. As a static method on the constructor function or class

Let's explore each method:

1. Attaching a function to the prototype:

```javascript
function MyClass(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

MyClass.prototype.greet = function () {
	console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
};

const obj1 = new MyClass('Alice');
const obj2 = new MyClass('Bob');

obj1.greet(); // Output: Hello, Alice!
obj2.greet(); // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

Real-world example: `Array.prototype.filter()`

The `filter()` method is attached to the `Array.prototype`, so all array instances can use it:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

2. Attaching a function directly to the object (instance method):

```javascript
const obj = {
	name: 'Charlie',
	greet: function () {
		console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}!`);
	},
};

obj.greet(); // Output: Hi, I'm Charlie!
```

Real-world example: Methods in custom objects

While less common in built-in JavaScript objects, this pattern is often used when creating custom objects:

```javascript
const calculator = {
	value: 0,
	add: function (x) {
		this.value += x;
		return this;
	},
	subtract: function (x) {
		this.value -= x;
		return this;
	},
	getValue: function () {
		return this.value;
	},
};

console.log(calculator.add(5).subtract(2).getValue()); // Output: 3
```

<Callout type='tip'>
	The above calculator example was asked in an Adobe Computer Scientist
	interview.

3. Attaching a function as a static method:

```javascript
function MyClass(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

MyClass.staticGreet = function (name) {
	console.log(`Static hello to ${name}!`);
};

MyClass.staticGreet('David'); // Output: Static hello to David!

// With ES6 class syntax:
class NewClass {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	static staticGreet(name) {
		console.log(`Static hello to ${name}!`);
	}
}

NewClass.staticGreet('Eve'); // Output: Static hello to Eve!
```

Real-world example: `Promise.all()`

`Promise.all()` is a static method on the `Promise` constructor. It's called on the `Promise` class itself, not on instances of promises:

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => {
	console.log(values); // Output: [3, 42, 'foo']
});
```

Another example of a static method is `Object.keys()`:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

<Callout>
	The main differences lie in memory usage, inheritance, and usage patterns.
	Prototype methods are shared among all instances, instance methods are unique
	to each object, and static methods are called on the class itself. Built-in
	JavaScript functions and methods use these patterns based on their intended
	use and behavior.
</Callout>

## Follow Up Questions

### What are the performance implications of each approach?

1. Prototype methods: Memory-efficient for multiple instances as the function is shared.
2. Instance methods: Use more memory if many instances are created, as each has its own function copy.
3. Static methods: Single copy in memory, not duplicated for instances.

### How does inheritance work with these different approaches?

1. Prototype methods: Inherited by all instances and subclasses.
2. Instance methods: Not inherited, specific to each instance.
3. Static methods: Inherited by subclasses but not available on instances.

```javascript
class Parent {
	static staticMethod() {
		console.log('Parent static method');
	}
}
Parent.prototype.protoMethod = function () {
	console.log('Parent prototype method');
};

class Child extends Parent {}

Child.staticMethod(); // Output: Parent static method
new Child().protoMethod(); // Output: Parent prototype method
```

### When would you choose one approach over the others?

1. Prototype methods: When the function should be shared across all instances and inherited by subclasses.
2. Instance methods: When you need instance-specific behavior or the method relies heavily on instance-specific data.
3. Static methods: For utility functions related to the class but not dependent on instance data.

### How do these approaches work with the `this` keyword?

1. Prototype and instance methods: `this` refers to the instance.
2. Static methods: `this` refers to the class itself, not an instance.

```javascript
class Example {
	constructor(value) {
		this.value = value;
	}

	protoMethod() {
		console.log(this.value);
	}

	static staticMethod() {
		console.log(this.value); // undefined
		console.log(this); // [class Example]
	}
}

const ex = new Example(42);
ex.protoMethod(); // Output: 42
Example.staticMethod(); // Output: undefined, then [class Example]
```

# Polyfill: Function.prototype.bind() Method

> Why did the JavaScript function use bind()? Because it wanted to stay attached to its favorite context!

Polyfills are a way to add functionality to the JavaScript language by implementing methods that are not natively supported. This is useful for older browsers that do not support newer features of the language. Additionally, they are interview questions that are commonly asked in JavaScript interviews. In this exercise, you will implement a polyfill for the Function.prototype.bind() method.

## Objectives

- Understand how the Function.prototype.bind() method works in JavaScript.
- Implement a polyfill for the Function.prototype.bind method called Function.prototype.myBind.
- Write tests to verify your implementation behaves as expected.

## Tests

Consider writing tests based on your understanding of the Function.prototype.bind() method. You can also do a TDD approach to this problem if you prefer.

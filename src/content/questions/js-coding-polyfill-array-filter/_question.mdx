# Polyfill: Array.filter() Method

> Why did the JavaScript developer leave the restaurant? Because they didn't like the array of options and decided to filter them out themselves!

Polyfills are a way to add functionality to the JavaScript language by implementing methods that are not natively supported. This is useful for older browsers that do not support newer features of the language. Also, they are interview questions that are commonly asked in JavaScript interviews. In this exercise, you will implement a polyfill for the Array.filter() method.

## Objectives

- Understand how the Array.filter() method works in JavaScript.
- Implement a polyfill for the Array.filter method called Array.myFilter.
- Write tests to verify your implementation behaves as expected.

## Tests

Consider writing tests based on your understanding of the Array.filter() method. You can also do a TDD approach to this problem if you prefer.

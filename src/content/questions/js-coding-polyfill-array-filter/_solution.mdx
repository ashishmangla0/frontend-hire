# Solution

TDD (test-driven development) shines in this type of scenario. We will also use the same approach here.

## Understanding the Array.filter() Method

Let us first understand the array filter method by trying out a few examples.

<Callout>
	We suggest you also do this in an interview setting. As this helps you form a
	better thought process. This also clears up some of the edge cases. You can
	also pull up the documentation (we encourage doing this) if the interviewer
	has no issue with that.
</Callout>

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

arr.filter((number) => number > 5); // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

function isEven(number) {
	return number % 2 === 0;
}

arr.filter(isEven); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

arr.filter((...args) => console.log(args)); // [1, 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]], [2, 1, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]] etc.,
// Basically, the first argument is the item, the second is the index, and the third is the array itself.
```

So, the filter method takes a callback function as a parameter and returns a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the function.

<Callout type='warn'>
	Array.filter method also takes another parameter which is `thisArg`. This is a
	little out of the scope of this question. But it is used to specify the value
	of `this` inside the callback function.
</Callout>

## Tests

Let us first write the tests for the following cases:

### Filters values based on the item

```js title="index.test.js"
test('filters values based on the item', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

	expect(arr.myFilter((item) => item > 5)).toEqual([6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
});
```

This is the most common use case that we also use with the regular filter method.

### Filters values based on the index

```js title="index.test.js"
test('filters values based on the index', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

	expect(arr.myFilter((_item, index) => index > 5)).toEqual([7, 8, 9, 10]);
});
```

This time instead of the first argument of the callback function, we use the second argument. We use `_underscore` to indicate that we are not using the first argument.

### Filters values based on the item and the array itself

```js title="index.test.js"
test('filters values based on the item and the array itself', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

	expect(arr.myFilter((item, _index, array) => item > array[5])).toEqual([
		7, 8, 9, 10,
	]);
});
```

We now use both the first and the third argument in the callback function. Just using the third argument does not make any sense.

Putting them all together:

```js title="index.test.js" showLineNumbers
import { describe, test, beforeAll, expect } from 'vitest';

import { myFilter } from '.';

describe('polyfill-array-filter', () => {
	beforeAll(() => {
		Array.prototype.myFilter = myFilter;
	});

	test('filters values based on the item', () => {
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

		expect(arr.myFilter((item) => item > 5)).toEqual([6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
	});

	test('filters values based on the index', () => {
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

		expect(arr.myFilter((_item, index) => index > 5)).toEqual([7, 8, 9, 10]);
	});

	test('filters values based on the item and the array itself', () => {
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

		expect(arr.myFilter((item, _index, array) => item > array[5])).toEqual([
			7, 8, 9, 10,
		]);
	});
});
```

## The Polyfill

<Callout type='error'>
	The actual implementation would be different from what we implement here. This
	is because for an interview setting this is more than enough. But if you were
	actually implementing a JS polyfill for production (quite rare), you would
	need to check the actual specification and handle more edge cases than what
	you see here.
</Callout>

Now that the basic tests are done, we can start implementing the actual polyfill.

```js title="index.js" ins={2}
export function myFilter(cb) {
	const result = [];
}
```

We will use the `result` array to store the filtered values. Remember that we need to return a new array and not modify the original array. Of course, we return a shallow copy of the original array.

```js title="index.js" ins={4-10}
export function myFilter(cb) {
	const result = [];

	for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
		if (cb(this[i], i, this)) {
			result.push(this[i]);
		}
	}

	return result;
}
```

Now for each of the values in the original array, we call the callback function and check if it returns `true`. If it does, we push the value to the `result` array. As per our understanding of the Array.filter method, we have to pass the following arguments to the callback function:

- The item: **this[i]**
- The index: **i**
- The array itself: **this**

We then just return the `result` array. This should pass all the tests.

## Optional: Handling the `thisArg` Argument

<Callout>
	This is an optional challenge, pretty rare for an interviewer to ask you to do
	it. But we want you to excel in these challenges. So, here goes the better
	solution.
</Callout>

```js title="index.test.js"
test('filters values using thisArg', () => {
	const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	const filterObj = { limit: 3 };

	function filterFunction(item) {
		return item <= this.limit;
	}

	expect(arr.myFilter(filterFunction, filterObj)).toEqual([1, 2, 3]);
});
```

We add the `thisArg` argument to the callback function. We pass the `filterObj` object as the `thisArg` argument.

So, now our implementation changes a bit and uses `call` to handle the `thisArg` argument.

```js title="index.js" showLineNumbers {1, 5}
export function myFilter(cb, thisArg) {
	const result = [];

	for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
		if (cb.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this)) {
			result.push(this[i]);
		}
	}

	return result;
}
```

Take your time to understand the `call` method. We have a polyfill question on [`Function.prototype.call()`](./polyfill-function-call) too.
